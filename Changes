        - fix Request.pm to clone the extra attributes we've
          added (Marc Tobias)

0.10_01 Mon Jan 22 2007
        - use URI::Template for parsing OSD uri templates
        - added opensearch-specific Request and Agent classes
        - un-break get_best_url()
        - you can now pass a WWW::OpenSearch::Url to WWW::OpenSearch's
          search() method
        - added ns() (namespace) field to Url.pm
        - re-worked paging to use the new Request object

        [ THINGS THAT MAY BREAK YOUR CODE ]
        - using URI::Template means some methods are now proxied to
          that class
        - removed agent argument in new() in OpenSearch.pm
        - handling of POST requests in prepare_query() in Url.pm now 
          returns data suitable for passing to HTTP::Request
        - un-link Response.pm and the parent WWW::OpenSearch object --
          a Response is now in the context of whatever
          WWW::OpenSearch::Url was used
