 - use URI::Template for parsing OSD uri templates

 - you can now pass a WWW::OpenSearch::Url to WWW::OpenSearch's search()
   method
 - added ns() (namespace) field to Url.pm
 - re-worked paging to use the new Request object

 [THINGS THAT MAY BREAK YOUR CODE]
 - using URI::Template means some methods are now proxied to that class
 - removed agent argument in new() in OpenSearch.pm
 - handling of POST requests in prepare_query() in Url.pm now  returns data
   suitable for passing to HTTP::Request
 - un-link Response.pm and the parent WWW::OpenSearch object -- a Response
   is now in the context of whatever WWW::OpenSearch::Url was used
